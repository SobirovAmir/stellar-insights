?What are the two basic types of image sensors?
+ CCD and CMOS
- MOS and BJT
- LED and LCD
- TFT and OLED
?What is the primary difference between CCD and CMOS image sensors?
+ The readout mechanism: CCD shifts charge, CMOS uses row and column decoders
- CCD uses CMOS decoders, CMOS shifts charge
- CCD is analog only, CMOS is digital only
- CMOS has higher noise than CCD
?What is the basic unit of many CCD structures?
+ MOS capacitor
- Photogate transistor
- Pinned diode
- CMOS transistor
?Which of the following is NOT a type of CCD structure?
+ Random Access CCD
- Interline Transfer CCD (IT-CCD)
- Frame Transfer CCD (FT-CCD)
- Backside-Illuminated CCD (BSI-CCD)
?In CCD operation, what happens after photons generate charge in the pixels?
+ Charge packets are sequentially transferred to the output stage and converted into electrical signals
- Charge packets remain in the pixel indefinitely
- Photons are converted directly into digital values
- Charge is transferred wirelessly to another sensor

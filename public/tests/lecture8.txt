?What is the main challenge of photometry in crowded stellar fields?
+ Overlapping stellar images leading to inaccurate flux measurements
- Low signal-to-noise ratio in isolated stars
- Atmospheric extinction of single stars
- Detector dark current in empty regions
?Which photometry method is preferred in dense fields?
+ PSF fitting photometry
- Aperture photometry
- Differential photometry
- Spectrophotometry
?What is the role of ALLSTAR in crowded field photometry?
+ Iteratively fits the PSF to stars and refines their magnitudes and positions
- Generates synthetic star clusters for testing
- Performs spectroscopy on stars
- Detects cosmic rays and removes them only
?What are the key requirements for PSF stars in ALLSTAR?
+ Isolated, unsaturated, evenly distributed, representative of image quality
- Very bright, clustered, saturated stars
- Only stars near the image center
- Random faint stars without concern for isolation
?Why is iterative fitting and subtraction important in ALLSTAR?
+ It uncovers faint stars hidden by brighter neighbors and improves completeness
- It calibrates the telescope optics automatically
- It converts CCD counts to absolute flux units
- It filters out background galaxies exclusively

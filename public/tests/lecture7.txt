?What is the main purpose of GALFIT 3?
+ To perform 2D parametric modeling of galaxies’ surface brightness
- To generate spectroscopic data for stars
- To simulate telescope optics
- To measure the chemical composition of galaxies
?Which components can GALFIT 3 fit simultaneously in crowded fields?
+ Bulges, disks, bars, spiral arms, and neighboring galaxies
- Only single isolated galaxies
- Stars individually without considering galaxies
- Planetary nebulae exclusively
?What is the role of the PSF in GALFIT 3 fitting?
+ Convolves the model with observational point-spread effects
- Removes cosmic rays from the image
- Converts CCD data to spectral flux
- Generates artificial stars in the image
?What does a high Sérsic index (n ≈ 4) indicate about a galaxy?
+ Bulge-dominated morphology
- Disk-dominated morphology
- Galaxy with strong spiral arms
- Galaxy with low surface brightness
?What type of output files does GALFIT 3 produce?
+ Best-fit model image, residual image, and parameter file with uncertainties
- Only a residual image
- Only a log of PSF parameters
- FITS images without model information

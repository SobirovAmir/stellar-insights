?What is the main purpose of preliminary analysis in astronomical images?
+ To examine, correct, and evaluate raw data for reliability before scientific interpretation
- To publish images directly without processing
- To increase the size of astronomical images
- To generate random image noise
?Which detectors are commonly used to capture astronomical images?
+ CCDs and CMOS sensors
- Plasma monitors and CRT displays
- Photographic film only
- Infrared cameras exclusively
?What is the formula for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in astronomical images?
+ SNR = S / √(S + N), where S is signal and N is noise
- SNR = S * N, where S is signal and N is noise
- SNR = S / N^2, where S is signal and N is noise
- SNR = (S + N) / S, where S is signal and N is noise
?Which software package is primarily used for reducing CCD images to pixel arrays for statistical analysis?
+ IRAF
- CASA
- STSDAS
- Photoshop
?What is the purpose of shape index profile analysis in preliminary astronomical image processing?
+ To measure local curvature and orientation for object classification
- To apply color filters to the image
- To convert images into 3D models for printing
- To remove cosmic ray events

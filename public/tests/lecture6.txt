?What is the main purpose of astronomical photometry?
+ To measure the flux or intensity of light from celestial objects
- To determine the chemical composition of planets only
- To create 3D models of galaxies
- To calibrate telescope optics
?Which instruments are commonly used for photometry?
+ CCD photometers and photoelectric photometers
- Spectrophotometers exclusively
- Only human eye observations
- Radio antenna arrays
?What is differential photometry?
+ Comparing the brightness of a target object with nearby stars using the same instrument
- Measuring the total light of a galaxy per square arcsecond
- Measuring only the brightest star in a field
- Applying random filters to stars for observation
?How is surface brightness typically expressed in astronomical photometry?
+ Magnitudes per square arcsecond
- Luminosity in watts
- Apparent magnitude only
- Flux in photons per second
?What does the B–V colour index indicate?
+ The temperature and colour of a star
- The distance to a galaxy
- The chemical composition of a star
- The age of a star cluster
